# Dealing-With-Imbalanced-Dataset

Here we will be dealing with Credit Fraud dataset, here we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. 

Our Goals:
*  Understand the distribution of data that was provided.
* Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions.
* Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
* Comparing undersampling and oversampling which is to be preferred.

The main objective is to find handle the imbalance dataset and choose the right machine learning algorithm.
